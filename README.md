# Neopixel60Clock
Created a clock that runs on an DS1307 RealTime Clock.  
It has 4 different clock forms, selectable via button press.  
The seconds, minutes, and hour can be adjusted with button presses as well.  
This reprograms the RTC.  
A 4th button allows the use of a potentiometer to set the 
brightness of different parts of the clock (as well as choosing colors to display on the clock).  
A photoresistor also detects room brightness and adjusts the clock intensity accordingly.
